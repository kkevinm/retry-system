; This file is where you set Retry's level-specific settings.
; You can add how many settings you want, each in a separate line.
; Supported settings (for each, write level as $XXX, like $105 for sublevel 105):
;
;   %checkpoint(level, value): configure the checkpoint behavior in the level, depending on value:
;     0 = vanilla checkpoint behavior (midway in the sublevel will lead to the main level's midway entrance)
;     1 = midway in the sublevel will lead to the sublevel's midway entrance
;     2 = any main/midway/secondary entrance to this sublevel will trigger a checkpoint
;     3 = both effects of 1 and 2
;
;   %retry(level, value): configure the Retry type in the level, depending on value:
;     0 = follow the global setting (!default_prompt_type)
;     1 = Retry prompt and play the death jingle when dying (music will be reset)
;     2 = Retry prompt and only play the death sfx when dying (music won't be interrupted)
;     3 = instant Retry and only play the death sfx when dying (no prompt and music won't be interrupted)
;     4 = instant Retry and play the death jingle when dying (no prompt and the music will be reset)
;     5 = no Retry (vanilla death)
;
;   %checkpoint_retry(level, checkpoint, retry): configure both checkpoint and Retry types in the level
;
;   %sfx_echo(level): toggle sfx echo in the level
;
;   %no_reset_rng(level): don't reset the rng when retrying in the level
;
;   %no_room_cp_sfx(level): don't play the room checkpoint sfx when entering the level
;
;   %no_lose_lives(level): enable infinite lives in the level
;
;   %settings(level, checkpoint, retry, sfx_echo, no_reset_rng, no_room_cp_sfx, no_lose_lives): configure all settings for the level
