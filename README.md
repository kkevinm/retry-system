## Retry System

If you just stumbled here and have no idea what this is about, check out [SMWCentral](https://www.smwcentral.net/).

### Description

This is the modern Retry System that extends and improves the [original patch](https://smwc.me/1657727) by [worldpeace](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=1250). Its base features are the same as the old patch, but there's a lot of new functionalities and customizations available, which make it an useful tool also for projects where a retry system is not needed. Additionally, being implemented as an UberASM project, it features much less hijacks than the original patch, making it compatible with more resources. [UberASM Tool](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=19982) version 2.0 or higher is required.

The main features implemented are:
- Level respawn on death without going to the Overworld (with prompt or instant)
- Customizable Retry prompt appearance
- Multiple midways per level
- Automatic midways when entering a sublevel
- Customizable sprite status bar that replaces the vanilla one
- Death counter
- SRAM+/BW-RAM+ like saving system to save checkpoints and other stuff without needing other patches
- Title screen death fix
- Counterbreak
- Miscellaneous bug fixes
