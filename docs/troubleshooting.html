<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<br/>

<h4>Q: I applied a FG gradient code, and it appears above the Retry prompt as well!</h4>
<p>A: You need to make a slight edit to the HDMA code. You should see something like this:</p>

<pre>
LDA #$17
STA $212C
LDA #$00
STA $212E
</pre>

<p>Change that to:</p>

<pre>
LDA #$17
STA $212C
LDA #$17	;<- change here
STA $212E
</pre>

<hr>

<h4>Q: I'm making the music in a level fade out using the following code (with AMK) but the music doesn't reload when dying!</h4>

<pre>
LDA #$FF
STA $1DFB
</pre>

<p>A: You want to also store <code>#$FF</code> to <code>$0DDA</code>, like this:</p>

<pre>
LDA #$FF
STA $1DFB
STA $0DDA	;<- change here
</pre>

<hr>
<h4>Q: When dying after getting the goal post or beating a boss, the music doesn't restart when respawning!</h4>
<p>A: One common cause for this is a bug with AddmusicK that happens when you change certain songs to <code>#$00</code> in the <u class="dir">asm/tweaks.asm</u> (or <u class="dir">asm/UserDefines.asm</u>) file, specifically: <code>!Miss</code>, <code>!BossClear</code>, <code>!StageClear</code>, <code>!Keyhole</code> or <code>!IrisOut</code> (maybe also <code>!SwitchPalace</code>, <code>!RescueEgg</code> and <code>!StaffRoll</code>). This can cause issues like the one mentioned here or the P-Switch/Star timers acting weirdly when activated</p>
<p>To fix this, open AMK's <u class="dir">asm/SNES/patch.asm</u> file and remove all instances of codes like this:</p>

<pre>
CMP !SongThatYouChangedTo0
BEQ Something
</pre>

<p>For example, if you changed <code>!IrisOut</code> to <code>#$00</code>, then you'd remove these codes (you can <b>CTRL+F</b> <code>!IrisOut</code> to find all instances in the file):</p>

<pre>
CMP !IrisOut
BEQ ++
CMP !IrisOut
BEQ LevelEndMusicChange
CMP !IrisOut
BEQ Okay
</pre>

<p>Run AddmusicK after applying the changes and the issue should be fixed. If it still happens but you didn't change the tweaks/UserDefines file, then DM me the issue.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Q: I'm using the "Single Screen" UberASM code, and sprites keep moving while Mario is dead!</h4>
<p>A: To fix, add this code at the very start of the Single Screen's main code:</p>

<pre>
LDA $71
CMP #$09
BNE +
RTL
+
</pre>

<h4>Q: I set a custom midway entrance value to a secondary exit, but it doesn't work!</h4>
A: Secondary entrances that are already present in the original game won't work properly. To make it work, delete it and remake it in LM.

<hr>
<h4>Q: When I enter a level from the overworld, it brings me to the bonus game!</h4>
<p>A: After inserting this, make sure to start from a new save file.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Q: I use a custom midway block/sprite, but it doesn't seem to work!</h4>
<p>By default Retry only works with the vanilla midway tile, but it's fairly straightforward to make it work with your own blocks/sprites. Retry has a specific RAM address that can be used to set the midway in the current level (according to the <code>checkpoint</code> table in <u class="dir">retry_config/tables.asm</u>). The address is <code>!ram_set_checkpoint</code> to have it always available in sprites/blocks, you can copy the contents of "ram.asm" into PIXI's <u class="dir">asm/sa1def.asm</u>, GPS's <u class="dir">defines.asm</u> and UberASM Tool's <u class="dir">other/macro_library.asm</u>.</p>
<p>The system works as follows: if you set the low byte (<code>!ram_set_checkpoint</code>) to <code>#$00</code>, it will trigger the current level's midway. If the checkpoint table for this sublevel is 0, it means it will give you the midway for the main level. While if it's 2 or 3, it will give you the midway for the current sublevel.</p>
<p>You can also set a completely custom entrance for the checkpoint, similarly to how Retry's custom midway objects work. To do this, you need to set the entire 16 bit address (<code>!ram_set_checkpoint</code> and <code>!ram_set_checkpoint+1</code>) to the entrance value you want to use. This value follows the format of $7E19B8 and $7E19D8 (where $7E19B8 should go in the first byte of the address, $7E19D8 in the second). For more info, check those addresses in SMWCentral's RAM Map. In practice, your midway block sprite should have a piece of code like this, to set the vanilla midway:</p>


<pre>
LDA #$01
STA $13CE
</pre>

<p>To add multiple midway support, you'd just need to add this after it:</p>

<pre>
LDA #$00
STA !ram_set_checkpoint
</pre>

<p>To make the midway take you to an arbitrary entrance, you need to set a different value depending on what entrance it is. For example, to make it use secondary exit number $0169, you'd use this code:</p>

<pre>
REP #$20
LDA #$0169	; Secondary exit number.
ORA #$0200	; Set the "secondary exit" bit in the high byte (like $7E19D8).
STA !ram_set_checkpoint
SEP #$20
</pre>

<p>Additionally, you can also reset the current level's checkpoint by setting !ram_set_checkpoint to #$80. This will respawn Mario in the current level's main entrance when dying.</p>

<ul>
	<li>if !save_on_checkpoint = 1, using this method will also make the game save.</li>
	<li>if using the "Individual Dragon Coins Save" patch, using this method will also make the current Dragon Coins save (when !Midpoint = 1 in that patch).</li>
	<li>this address is only checked while in a level, but you can also set it in other situations (in this case, the checkpoint will be registered the first time a level is entered).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q: I patched the 32x32 Player Tilemap patch / lx5's Custom Powerups / lx5's Dynamic Spriteset System (DSS) / DKCR Status Bar (or other sprite status bars) and I get glitched graphics when dying! What do I do?</h4>
<p>A: Those patches have a high chance of using the same spots in SP1 for their dynamic tiles as the Retry prompt. To fix it, open "settings.asm" and towards the bottom you'll see a bunch of !tile_... defines. You need to edit some of those to other free spots in SP1 that aren't used by other patches.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Q: I'm using !prompt_freeze = 0 to make sprites move while Mario is dead, but it also causes autoscrollers to keep going. How do I stop them?</h4>
<p>A: vanilla autoscrollers should already stop when dying with this options turned on, while custom autoscrollers need to be handled on a case-by-case basis by adding a check for Mario's state. This is usually simple to fix by adding a code like this at the beginning of your custom autoscroller:</p>

<pre>
LDA $71
CMP #$09
BNE .run
RTL
.run:
</pre>

<p>(if your autoscroller code is in a routine that ends with RTS, use RTS instead of RTL before <code>.run</code>).</p>
