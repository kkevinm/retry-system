<h1>ObjecTool Information</h1>
<p>If you want to insert custom objects using the ObjecTool patch, and you're using Retry's Custom Midway Object feature (<code>!use_custom_midway_bar = 1</code> in the settings) you'll need to make an edit before inserting the patch.</p>
<p>Open <u class="dir">objectool.asm</u> and remove these lines (they're towards the top of the file):</p>

<pre>
org $0DA415|!bank                   ; x6A615 (hijack normal object loading routine)
	autoclean JML NewNormObjects    ; E2 30 AD 31 19
	NOP                             ;
</pre>

<p>After doing this, just patch <u class="dir">objectool.asm</u>.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that Retry will use slots <b>00-41</b> and <b>50-51</b> of the Custom Normal Objects (i.e., objects with id 2D) for its custom midway bars, meaning that you can't use them in ObjecTool.</p>
<p>You're free to use Custom Normal Objects <b>42-4F</b> and <b>52-FF</b>, as well as all Custom Extended Objects available.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want to remove Retry's custom midway bar while keeping ObjecTool, you'll need to place back the code that you removed in <u class="dir">objectool.asm</u> (and make sure you run Retry with <code>!use_custom_midway_bar = 0</code>).</p>
