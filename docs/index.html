	<h1>Retry System UberASM</h1>
	<p>The Retry System is a useful patch for both Kaizo hacks and generally hard hacks, as its primary function is to enable fast level reloading to skip going to the Overworld everytime the player dies (similarly to games like Super Meat Boy).</p>
	<p>This package is a spiritual successor of the <a href="https://smwc.me/1657727">original Retry patch</a> made by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=1250">worldpeace</a>, to expand its capabilities and to make it compatible with more resources as a consequence of it being primarily a UberASM resource.</p>

	<!-- Configuration -->
	<h3 id="config">Configuration</h3>
	<p>The Retry System can be configured in a lot of ways, from basic general settings, to level specific settings, to more nuanced options for advanced users.</p>
	<p>All the configuration files you can edit can be found in the <u class="dir">retry_config</u> folder and include some comments on how to use them and what they can do, but you can read more in depth explanation for each file below.</p>
	<p>The main files you'll need to edit are these:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="./settings_global.html">settings_global.asm (Global settings)</a></li>
		<li><a href="./settings_local.html">settings_local.asm (Per-level settings)</a></li>
		<li><a href="./sram_tables.html">sram_tables.asm (Save tables)</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The other asm files can be ignored for most use cases, but you can check out the <a href="#advanced">Advanced Usage</a> section below for more info.</p>
	<p>You can edit the files in the <u class="dir">retry_config/code</u> folder (which contains all the source code) to change the retry but this is <b>not recommended</b> unless you know exactly what you're doing.</p>
	<p>You can also edit the files in the <u class="dir">retry_config/gfx</u> folder to change how the Retry tiles look (see <a href="./files.html#gfx">Retry Resources - Graphics</a> for more information).</p>
	<br/>
	<!-- Midways -->
	<h3 id="multiple_midway">Multiple Midways</h3>
	<p>The Retry system also provides for multiple level midways, both as midway objects and automatic midways on level entrance, and many more features. Read how to configure this feature at the following link.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="./midway_instruction.html">Setting up Multiple Midways</a></li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<!-- Sprite Status Bar -->
	<h3 id="sprite-status-bar">Sprite Status Bar</h3>
	<p>The Retry System comes with a built-in sprite status bar system that can replace the vanilla layer 3 status bar, and includes a minimalistic status bar with display for lives, item box, coins, dragon coins, timer, bonus stars and death counter.</p>
	<p>Each of these items can be enabled or disabled at any time, so you can just display what is needed for your hack or for a particular level. This can be useful if you want to use fullscreen layer 3 backgrounds or just want a less dense status bar.</p>
	<p>For more information check out the following pages.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="./settings_global.html#sprite-status-bar">Global sprite status bar settings</a></li>
		<li><a href="./settings_local.html#ssb_config_item_box">Per-level sprite status bar settings</a></p></li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<!-- Advanced -->
	<h3 id="advanced">Advanced Usage</h3>
	<p>Besides the more straightforward global and per-level settings described before, you can use and customize the Retry more in depth if you know your way around coding in asm. Being more niche use cases and more complicated to use, you can avoid it if you're just interested in the run of the mill Retry experience (there's already enough to explore in the other setting files anyway...).</p>
